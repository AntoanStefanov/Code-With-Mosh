# Defining a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2]
# we learned that when we use the dot notation, we get access to all methods in list objects.
# Every list object in Python has these methods.
# numbers.

# Wouldn't that be nice if we could create an object like shopping_cart and this object would have methods
# like this:
# shopping_cart.add()
# shopping_cart.remove()
# shopping_cart.get_total()

# Another example:
# Would be nice if we could have a point object with methods.
# point.draw()
# point.move()
# point.get_distance() * between point x and point y


# Here come classes
# A class is a blueprint for creating new objects.
# Throughout the course you have heard the term class.
# For example: let's define a variable and set it to integer and print it's type

x = 1
print(type(x))
# We see a class of int
# So in Python we have a class called int for creating integers. Similarly, we have classes for creating booleans,
# lists, dictionaries and so on. 
# EVERY OBJECT WE HAVE IN PYTHON IS CREATED USING A CLASS WHICH IS A BLUEPRINT FOR CREATING OBJECTS OF THAT TYPE.
# 
# In this section you're going to learn how to create custom classes like customer, shopping_cart, point and so on.
# Before that let's define a few terms.

# 1.    Class: blueprint for creating new objects
# 2.    Object: instance of a class

# Example: 

# Class: Human (this class will define all the attributes of humans) then we could create objects
# Objects: John, Mary, ...
